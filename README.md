Based on the work of the [Wallet Provider](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/wallet-provider),
this project adds support for various extensions that allow for cryptographic operations in specific contexts.

## What are Extensions?

Extensions are modular components that enhance the capabilities of a wallet or provider. They allow for the addition of specialized features—such as secret management, logging, or custom signing—without bloating the core provider implementation.

An extension typically consists of:

1.  **State**: Data managed by the extension (e.g., a list of stored secrets).
2.  **API**: A set of methods to interact with the extension and its state.

## Available Extensions

The following extension packages are available in this workspace:

- **[Keystore Core](./keystore/store)**: Core types and interfaces for secret management.
- **[React Native Keystore](./keystore/react-native)**: Secure implementation for React Native using Keychain/MMKV.
  - [**Integration Guide**](./keystore/react-native/BOOTSTRAPPING.md): Detailed guide on how to adopt the keystore in React Native.
- **[Log Store](./log)**: Generalized logging extension for tracking wallet activity.

## Creating a New Extension

To create a new extension, you define an interface that combines your custom state and your API.

### Example: Logger Extension

Imagine you want an extension that logs all wallet activities.

#### 1. Define the Extension Types

```typescript
export interface LoggerState {
  logs: string[];
}

export interface LoggerApi {
  log: (message: string) => void;
  clear: () => void;
}

export interface LoggerExtension extends LoggerState {
  logger: LoggerApi;
}
```

#### 2. Implement the Extension

```typescript
import { Store } from "@tanstack/store";
import type { Provider, ExtensionOptions } from "@algorandfoundation/wallet-provider";

const store = new Store<LoggerState>({ logs: [] });

export const loggerExtension: (
  provider: Provider,
  options: ExtensionOptions,
) => LoggerExtension = () => ({
  get logs() {
    return store.state.logs;
  },
  logger: {
    log: (message: string) => {
      store.setState((state) => ({
        logs: [...state.logs, `${new Date().toISOString()}: ${message}`],
      }));
    },
    clear: () => {
      store.setState(() => ({ logs: [] }));
    },
  },
});

export default loggerExtension;
```

## Using Extensions in a Provider

Extensions are typically used by extending the base `Provider` class. This "concrete provider" pattern provides full type safety for both the core provider and all its extensions.

```typescript
import { Provider } from "@algorandfoundation/wallet-provider";
import { WithKeyStore } from "@algorandfoundation/react-native-keystore";
import { WithLogStore } from "@algorandfoundation/log-store";
import { keyStore } from "./stores/keystore";
import { logStore } from "./stores/logstore";

// 1. Define your application's provider with extensions
export class MyProvider extends Provider<typeof MyProvider.EXTENSIONS> {
  static EXTENSIONS = [WithLogStore, WithKeyStore] as const;

  // Add properties for type-safe access to extension state/APIs
  logs!: string[];
  keys!: any[];
  status!: string;
}

// 2. Initialize the provider with required options
const provider = new MyProvider(
  {
    id: "my-app",
    name: "My Application",
  },
  {
    logs: { store: logStore },
    keystore: {
      extension: { store: keyStore },
    },
  },
);

// 3. Access extension APIs directly on the provider
await provider.keystore.generate({ type: "hd-seed", algorithm: "raw" });
provider.log("Generated a new seed");
console.log(provider.keys); // Reactive list of keys
```
